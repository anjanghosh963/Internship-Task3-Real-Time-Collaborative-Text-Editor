## 📂 File Structure & Important Notes

Please read this section carefully before setting up the project:

* 📁 **Backend**: The `backend` folder is provided as-is and contains all the necessary server-side files.
* 📦 **Frontend (Frontend file)**: Due to file size limitations, the complete frontend application is contained within the **Frontend compressed file (e.g., Frontend.rar)**. **You must extract this file** to get all the necessary frontend source code before you can run the application.

# I've attached the Task 3 files in a RAR archive. You'll need to extract the archive to access the complete folder.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)
* A tool to extract `.rar` files (like WinRAR or 7-Zip).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Set Up the Backend**
    ```
    # Navigate to the backend directory
    cd backend

    # Install dependencies
    npm install

    # Start the backend server
    npm start
    ```
    > The backend server will now be running on `http://localhost:3001`.

3.  **Set Up the Frontend**
    ```
    # 1. From the project's root directory, find the 'Task 3.rar' file.
    # 2. Extract its contents. This will create a new folder containing the frontend React app.

    # 3. Navigate into the newly extracted frontend directory.
    #    (This might be the root folder if you extract here).
    cd <path-to-your-extracted-frontend-folder>

    # 4. Install dependencies
    npm install

    # 5. Start the frontend application
    npm start
    ```
    > The frontend application will automatically open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## 🔧 Usage

Once both the backend and frontend servers are running, open `http://localhost:3000` in multiple browser tabs to simulate different users. Any changes made in one tab will be instantly reflected in the others.
